This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

`npm run server` - Turns on API

### Before starting the application run next command:
`npm i json-server -g` - it installs json-server globally to load posts (perhaps, you'll need root access (sudo) to install that)
