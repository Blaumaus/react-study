## Available Scripts
`npm run start` - Run application client

`npm run server` - Turns on API

`npm run build` - Create a production build

`npm run serve` - Turn on static production server

### Before starting the application run next command:
`npm i json-server -g` - it installs json-server globally to load posts (perhaps, you'll need root access (sudo) to install that)
